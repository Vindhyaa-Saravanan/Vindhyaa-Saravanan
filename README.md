## Professional Experience 🌍🛠️

### Process Automation Summer Intern  
#### Schneider Electric Systems Middle East | June 2024 – Present
As a Process Automation Intern, I contributed to cybersecurity solutions for SCADA systems (supervisory control and data acquisition) by integrating virtualized environments with existing systems. This work required a deep understanding of virtual machines, network configurations, and security protocols, ensuring that systems operated securely while maintaining optimal performance. The documentation and testing I conducted during Cybersecurity Factory Acceptance Tests were instrumental in ensuring that these systems met stringent security standards before deployment. I also implemented and managed Acronis cybersecurity, which centralized backup policies for the organization, ensuring data integrity and quick recovery in case of breaches or failures.

### Research & Development Apprentice
#### AVEVA Solutions | June 2023 – August 2023
At AVEVA, my role was centered around cloud security and creating tools for improved team collaboration. I developed a comprehensive visualization dashboard using Atlassian Jira, providing a centralized view of project tasks, enhancing communication, and enabling informed decision-making across the team. Additionally, my work involved monitoring cloud infrastructure security using tools like Microsoft Azure Defender and AWS GuardDuty, helping the team proactively identify and address potential security threats. This project deepened my understanding of how to secure dynamic cloud environments and respond efficiently to potential threats while maintaining system performance.

### Cybersecurity Summer Intern
#### Schneider Electric Systems Middle East | July 2022 – September 2022
During my time at Schneider Electric, I had the opportunity to explore industrial control systems from a cybersecurity lens, where I worked hands-on with the integration of advanced cybersecurity solutions. One of my key roles was creating documentation for the IEC-62443 standard, a set of guidelines critical for safeguarding industrial automation and control systems. Leading a team in a qualitative analysis, I presented solutions to senior leadership, culminating in a project that focused on licensing models for service providers. This gave me a deep appreciation for the role that security plays in modern infrastructure and how critical it is to manage these systems with both technical acumen and strategic foresight.
